# Waste-Classifier
This project aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks in Tensorflow to classify Waste Objects as Organic Waste or Recyclable ones. This real-world application is useful as some people don't know whether to throw an object into the Organic waste bin or Recycle Bin. The data was taken from the Open Source Kaggle site which consisted of 25, 077 images of everyday items and the data were split into 85% Training and 15% Testing images. Please have a look :)

- Will need necessary hardware that can run Tensorflow 2.0.0 (necessary requirements: https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- Download ZIP file
- Run app.py
